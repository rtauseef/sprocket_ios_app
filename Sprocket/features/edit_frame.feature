Scenario Outline: Verify 'Frame' option
    Given I am on the "<screen_name>" screen
    When I tap "Edit" button
    Then I am on the "Edit" screen
    Then I tap "Frame" button
    Then I should see the "Frame Editor" screen
    Then I select "frame"
    And I verify blue line indicator is displayed under selected frame
    And I should see the photo with the "frame" 
    Then I tap "Close" mark
    Then I should see the "Edit" screen
    And I should see the photo with no frame

    | screen_name        |
