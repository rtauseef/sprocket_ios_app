/**
 This view controller is preconfigured with a camera session preview and handles detection and payoff presentation without requiring input from the host application.
 

 EasyReadingViewController is intended to be a simple plug-n-play solution to scanning and payoff display.
 
 Please read the Getting Started documentation for guidance on using the LinkReaderKit embedded framework.
 
 # Basic Usage - Presenting Modally
 
     ```
     // 1. Pass your credentials and a delegate to receive important callbacks, get a view controller
     
     EasyReadingViewController *vc = [[EasyReadingViewController alloc] initWithClientID:kTestClientID secret:kTestSecret delegate:self success:^{
        NSLog(@"Authorization complete!");

     } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // Handle Error

    }];

     // 2. Set the frame (will probably be full-screen)
     vc.view.frame = self.view.bounds;
     
     // 3. Present the view controller
     [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:^{
     NSLog(@"Easy as Ï€!");
     }];
     
     ```
 
 The `EasyReadingDelegate` also requires implementing `-readerError:`
 
     ```
     
     // 4. If something goes wrong, we'll tell you
     -(void)readerError:(NSError *)error {
     [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Easy Reading Error" message:@"Sorry, but there was a problem." delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles: nil] show];
     }
     
     ```
 
 Run the application. Note: the video preview and scanning capability are only available on-device, and therefore will not run in the Simulator. You will be able to present the preconfigured view controller, but you will only see a black background.

 ## Inserting Into Another View Controller
 
 In some cases, it may be desirable to insert the EasyReadingViewController's view directly into the view hierarchy of another view controller. In this case, create an instance of the EasyReadingViewController (ERCV) as you would normally. Next, add ERVC as a child view controller:
    
    ```
    -(void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
         self.easyReading = [[EasyReadingViewController alloc] initWithClientID:kTestClientID secret:kTestSecret delegate:self success:^{
            NSLog(@"Authorization complete!");
         } failure:^(NSError *error) {
            // Handle error
        }];

        [myViewController addChildViewController: self.easyReading];
        [self.view addSubview:self.easyReading.view];

    }

    -(void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
        [super viewWillAppear:animated];
        
        //Set the desired bounds; This could be full-screen, or just a portion
        self.easyReading.view.frame = self.view.bounds;
     }

    ```
