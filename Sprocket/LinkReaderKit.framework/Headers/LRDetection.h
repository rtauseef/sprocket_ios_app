/**
 The primary purpose of LRDetection is to allow the developer user to have finer-grained control over interaction with the LinkReaderSDK. If you wish to use a simple plug-n-play scanning + presentation option, see EasyReadingViewController. The LRDetection is the central class for listen detecton related events.
 
 Typical usage involves the following workflow
 
 1. In your view controller, set the delegate on the shared instance : `[[LRManager sharedManager] setDelegate:self]`
 2. Retrieve the video preview layer from LRManager and insert it into your preview subview
 3. Authorize the SDK using -authorizeWithClientID:secret:success:failure: , and begin scanning once the authorization is completed successfully
